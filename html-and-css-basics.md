# HTML and CSS Fundamentals

I. HTML
II. CSS

## HTML Basics
- HTML stands for hypertext markup language; used to add meaning to text and link documents to one another
- Tags: all content in an HTML document is located within a tag
  - There are many different tags, some of the most common are `<div>`, `<h>`, and `<p>`
  - It's good practice to put HTML inside an <html> tag
  - Tags can be placed inside other tags, like the example below
  - Note that all tags must have a starting and closing tag, except `<img>` 
- Basic structure of an HTML document:
```
 <!DOCTYPE html>
  <div>
    <p> A basic page! </p> 
  </div>
 </html>
```
