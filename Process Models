Software Process Model Notes
Models:
I.    Waterfall
II.   Rapid Prototyping
III.  Spiral 

Remember: The 3 essential ingredients of software engineering are:
  1) People
  2) Processes
  3) Tools 
  
 Difficulties of software engineering (SE):
  - Essential qualities: complexity, conformity, changeability, intangibility 
  - Those essential qualities can lead to drastic/disasterous consequences 
  
 Processes: 
  - Elements: phases, products, roles, resources
  - Relationships between elements: precedence, requires this or that, provides this or that...  
  - Constraints: time, cost, qualities 
 
 Models
 - A model is a simplified representation of something 
 - Prescriptive models enforce rules
 - Descriptive models describe or characterize
